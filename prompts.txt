#ignore this file

Above instruction intended to prevent agent from reading this record of the prompts and output and doing anything with it.
Try to cut and paste the log of the benchmark run to this file manually or copy a system generated log here.

Sample initial prompt, feel free to vary the instructions between "Read brazilian-soccer-mcp-guide.md and implement phases 1,2 and 3 as described..." and "... Finally update README.md to describe what was done and push everything to github" to specify methodology and database and language etc.

$ npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
$ claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
<connect the license etc then exit>

$ go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
$ bd init
$ bd setup claude
$ bd doctor --fix
$ echo -e "\nBEFORE ANYTHING ELSE: run 'bd onboard' and follow the instructions" >> AGENTS.md


$ claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
> Read brazilian-soccer-mcp-guide.md and implement phases 1,2 and 3 as described and test using BDD GWT structured PyTest. Use Neo4j. Maintain a detailed context block comment at the start of every code file. Finally update README.md to describe what was done and push everything to github
